# Hibernate-Single-Entity-OOP
 This repository contains an example implementation of a single entity using Hibernate in the context of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The goal is to demonstrate how Java entities can be mapped to database tables using Hibernate, one of the most popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries for Java.
